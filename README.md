my lawyers have advised me to clarify that any references to NSFW behavior contained within this source code is strictly extreme hyperbole 

### Todo:
#### Done:
* move all of that stupid bullshit in player.gd to the state machine and clean it up
* add running state
* add braking state for slowing down
#### Near future:
* add a boost meter (meter should function similarly to ultrakill stamina)
* add the boost + air boost (referencing Sonic Frontiers boost behavior)
* create an object to test environmental velocity on the player character
#### Later:
* add rails that can be grinded on
* add a balancing mechanic for said rails
* keep player magnetized to the ground when interacting with slopes (unless being launched)
* add slope physics (specifically mimicking that of the Sonic The Hedgehog games)
* add a ground attack
* add an aerial attack
* add an enemy to fight
* add an attack for that enemy
* make attacking an enemy give you a speed boost (some sort of style meter maybe that increases your speed cap???)
* add a dodge move or a parry or something maybe both??
#### Even LATER:
* finish a complete level with enemies to fight, decent level design, demonstrations of core gameplay mechanics, and an end goal
* make a tutorial level
#### When I get to it:
* Support for 16:9, 4:3, and 16:10
* Support for 240p (for use with CRT displays)
* Support for 240p super resolutions (for use with CRT displays via HDMI adapters)
#### this game is never coming out
* write the story
* create art for all needed contexts
* create sound design
* pray that someone is down to compose the music
* learn the basics of sound design
